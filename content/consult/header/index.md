Welcome, and thank you for visiting my website! 

I am a postdoctoral researcher with experience in ecological modeling, quantitative decision analysis, and data science. I am passionate about applied research and creating user-friendly tools for wildlife management. 

Currently, I am working at Tennessee Tech University with the [Cohen Ecology Lab](https://www.cohenwildlifelab.com/). As a postdoc with a specialty in ecological modeling, I get to dabble in all sorts of [research projects](/project) ranging from habitat selection and landscape ecology of mallards to adaptive harvest management of white-tailed deer and wild turkeys. Check out my most recent exploits below. 

**Here to learn?**  
I teach graduate level courses in the realm of population ecology, ecological modeling, statistics, and R programming. Many of the [course materials](/course) for my classes are free and open-source. Please [contact me](/contact) to inquire about private tutoring, workshops, or training. I also offer [data science consulting services](/consult) both as long-term contracted projects and as one time drop-in help.
