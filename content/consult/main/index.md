# <i class="fas fa-solid fa-laptop-code"></i> Contract Work  

Do you have a data science project that needs an expert touch? I am available for short-term contract or consulting work with a focus on statistical analysis, data exploration, and/or dashboard development.   

I prefer projects conducted primarily in R as that is my area of expertise. however I can use R to interface with python and SQL. Rates are negotiable by project and typically billed on a per-project basis rather than hourly. Please [contact me](/contact) and we can set up a time to discuss scope and cost.  

# <i class="fas fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i> Private Trainings  

If you or your organization are looking to level-up your R and data science skills, perhaps the time is right for a private training. This can take the form of an intensive 1-5 day workshop, a series of short weekly or biweekly meetings, or a virtual course designed to be completed by a deadline. Training material can be tailored to the needs and data structures of your projects.  

Check out my [course](/course), [workshop](/talk), and [project](/project) materials for a sampling of what I can create for you.  

# <i class="fas fa-calendar"></i> One-on-One Consulting  

If you are seeking a review of your statistical analysis or need assistance solving a pesky R problem, then a one-on-one session is a good option. This option is not recommended for large scale projects. One-on-One consulting is billed at a rate of $100/hour, and is dependent on availability.
