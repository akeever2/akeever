Welcome, and thank you for visiting my website! 

I am a postdoctoral researcher with experience in ecological modeling, quantitative decision analysis, and data science. I am passionate about applied research and creating user-friendly tools for wildlife management. 

Currently, I am working at Tennessee Tech University with the [Cohen Ecology Lab](https://www.cohenwildlifelab.com/). As a postdoc with a specialty in ecological modeling, I get to dabble in all sorts of [projects](/project): mallard landscape ecology, habitat selection, and response to disturbance; wild turkey reproductive ecology and brood habitat use; habitat availability and occupancy of secretive marsh birds; population monitoring of white-tailed deer; and developing an adaptive harvest management framework for deer and turkey populations in Tennessee. Check out my most recent exploits below.
